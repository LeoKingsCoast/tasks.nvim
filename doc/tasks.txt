This is a plugin to view and manage all tasks annotated in a given project. The 
plugin looks for TODO comments and unchecked markdown checkboxes, and displays
them in a window. The user can mark tasks as done in this window, and after
writing changes to it, the TODO comments marked as done will be deleted, and
the markdown checkboxes will be checked.

                                                             *tasks.task.Task*

        (numbers) specifying the location in the project the task was found.
        {markdown} (boolean?) Indicates if the task was found in a markdown 
        checkbox. Should be nil otherwise.
